## I'm currently working on:
 - Developing Synthetic Aperture Radar File Reading Tools
 - Examining various locations with NASA UAVSAR file data to better understand how various send and receive polarizations can be used to understand different landscape types.
 - Looking for data sets with flooding data to see how SAR data can be used to understand flooding.
 - Doing research on locations with high levels of water pollution that could be analyzed using remote sensing.
 - Writing software to process high definition NASA hyperspectral surface reflectance files.
  - Looking at ways of making NASA high definition hyperspectral surface reflectance files smaller and easier to access by a web interface.
 - Processing NASA impact (bolide) information and displaying a marker on Google Maps where the events occur
 - Processing SAR Files

 - Looking into applications of SAR (Synthetic Apperture Radar)
 - Looking at the NASA bolide database for meteor impact information and tools
 - Learning Web3 and blockchain technologies
 

## I'm currently learning

Web3 Technologies, Smart Contracts, Solidity, Web 3 User Front-ends to call Smart Contracts (using Viem, ethers.js), Smart Contract Security, NASA Datasets, Space Related Technology.

## I'm looking to collaberate on projects relating to:
 - Remote work with interesting projects
 - Machine learning applications
 - Web3 enabled websites using smart contracts
 - The environment
 - Education or educational tools
 - Data processing tools
 - Space based remote sensing data analysis
 - Projects raising awareness about:
   - Space and Space Exploration
   - Disasters affecting people
   - Asteroid and Comet monitoring and risks analysis and mitigation   
   - Animal welfare
   - Pollution, especially oil spills, ocean plastics, other serious pollution
   - The environment
