## I'm currently working on:
 - Doing research on locations with high levels of water pollution that could be analyzed using remote sensing.
 - Writing software to process high definition NASA hyperspectral surface reflectance files.
  - Looking at ways of making NASA high definition hyperspectral surface reflectance files smaller and easier to access by a web interface.
 - Processing NASA impact (bolide) information and displaying a marker on Google Maps where the events occur
 - Processing SAR Files

   More information: https://github.com/RLJLW/space-data-projects
 - Looking into applications of SAR (Synthetic Apperture Radar)
 - Looking at the NASA bolide database for meteor impact information and tools
 - Learning Web3 and blockchain technologies
 

## I'm currently learning

Web3 Technologies, Smart Contracts, Solidity, Web 3 User Front-ends to call Smart Contracts (using Viem, ethers.js), Smart Contract Security, NASA Datasets, Space Related Technology.
